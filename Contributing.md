## How Minipil Was Born

Minipil started with something very mundane:
the photo upload section of the GATE exam form.

The form required:
- specific aspect ratios
- strict pixel dimensions
- exact file sizes in KB
- certain formats
- and zero room for mistakes

I uploaded it the first time, and to my surprise, I got a revert saying my photograph was inaccurate. Frustrated (and extremely worried), I uploaded a newer and better photograph, following the requirements as meticulously as I could, only to get a revert again.
At this point, I didn’t trust myself anymore.
Eventually, I asked a friend for help. (Yes, she fixed it and yes my form got accepted.)

This made me think, and think some more. What if I could make things simpler for lazybugs like me?

And so, minipil was born!
